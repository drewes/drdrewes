          We strive to create an environment of acceptance, hope and healing.
          We believe optimal health is achieved through helping restore the
          functional pathways of the body and through preventing disease by
          correcting deficiencies at the earliest opportunity. We believe optimal
          health is possible for every patient regardless of their medical
          condition.
